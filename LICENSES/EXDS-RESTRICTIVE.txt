the name "Exodus Restrictive License" by the Licensor defined below.

By using, copying, or modifying any part of these materials, you
(the Licensee) agree to be bound by the terms of this license.

1. DEFINITIONS

1.1 "Licensor" means Maxim Bychkov (Lokilife) and any other person or
entity that has the right to grant rights under this license.

1.2 "Licensee" means any individual or entity that exercises the rights
granted under this license.

1.3 "Space Exodus Projects" means the software projects hosted under
the GitHub organization https://github.com/space-exodus/ (the URL may be
changed by the Licensor without requiring an amendment to this license).
Any project that is part of that organization is considered a Space
Exodus Project.

1.4 "Work" means any copyrightable work (including but not limited to

this license.

1.5 "Local Hosting" means running the Work on a device or network that

example, running the Work on a personal computer, a local area network
without public exposure, or a private test server that requires
authentication and is not intended for public use.

1.6 "Public Hosting" means making the Work available to the general
public over the internet or any other publicly accessible network,
regardless of whether a fee is charged. Examples include, but are not
limited to, running an online game server that can be joined by anyone,
hosting the Work on a public website, or providing it as a cloud service.

2. GRANT OF LICENSE

Subject to the terms and conditions of this license, the Licensor hereby
grants Licensee a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable,
non-exclusive, and revocable (as provided in Section 8) license to use,
copy, modify, and prepare derivative works of the Work solely:

   (a) as part of a Space Exodus Project – i.e., the Work may only be
       used, copied, modified, and distributed when it is integrated into
       a project that is officially part of the Space Exodus Projects.
       Any separate use or distribution of the Work (or a derivative
       thereof) outside a Space Exodus Project is prohibited unless
       explicitly permitted in writing by the Licensor.

   (b) for Local Hosting for development and improvement purposes –
       Licensee may host the Work locally, on a non-public network, for the
       sole purpose of developing, testing, or improving the Work or a
       Space Exodus Project. This right does not extend to Public Hosting.

The Licensor reserves all rights not expressly granted in this license.

3. RESTRICTIONS

3.1 No Public Hosting. Licensee may not engage in Public Hosting of the
Work or any derivative thereof, unless the Licensor has given separate,
explicit written permission. Public Hosting includes, but is not limited to,
operating a publicly accessible game server or offering the Work as a
network service.

3.2 No Separate Distribution. Licensee may not distribute, sublicense,
or otherwise make available the Work (or any derivative) on a standalone
basis, i.e., not integrated into a Space Exodus Project.

3.3 No Removal of Notices. Licensee must retain all copyright, license,
and other proprietary notices contained in the original Work in any
authorized copy.

3.4 No Trademark Use. This license does not grant permission to use the
trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
origin of the Work.

4. EXCEPTIONS

Notwithstanding the above restrictions, the Licensor may, at their sole
discretion, grant specific permissions to a Licensee (such as the right to
engage in Public Hosting or to use the Work outside a Space Exodus Project).
Any such permission must be in writing and signed by the Licensor (Maxim
Bychkov, or a person authorized by him). In the absence of a separate
written agreement, the terms of this license apply fully.

5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY

OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

7. TERMINATION

Any violation of the terms of this license automatically terminates the

copies in their possession. The Licensor may also seek any other remedies
available under law.
