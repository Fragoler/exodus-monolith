## Code License Timeline

### Current Licensing
**New Contributions (after January 12, 2026):** Exodus Restrictive License (EXDS-RL).
See [EXDS-RESTRICTIVE.txt](LICENSES/EXDS-RESTRICTIVE.txt).

**Note:** Although new contributions are licensed under EXDS-RL, the project as a whole must currently be distributed under AGPLv3 due to inherited code. This will change in future versions.

When incorporating changes from Monolith (especially those made after January 12, 2026), please obtain them directly from the original repository to ensure compliance with its license terms and to avoid confusion with the EXDS‑RL licensing of new contributions in this project.
