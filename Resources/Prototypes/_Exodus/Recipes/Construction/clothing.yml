  description: To the Arachnids, silk is more than mere material — it is a language frozen in patterns. Every thread, every curve is a tale woven from personal history, oaths, and the legacy of an entire bloodline. Such a gift is the rarest of honors, for to give another a piece of one's own fate is an act reserved only for those deemed equal... or worthy of becoming part of the Kin's story.
